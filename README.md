# Payment API

## Overview

The Payment API is a Flask-based application that provides a system for managing (for now) only PIX payments. It uses SQLAlchemy for ORM and SQLite as the database backend. The application also integrates with Socket.IO to handle real-time notifications.


## Features

- **Create PIX Payments**: Endpoint to create new PIX payments with QR code generation.
- **Confirm PIX Payments**: Endpoint to confirm payments and update their status.
- **Retrieve QR Code**: Endpoint to fetch QR code images for payments.
- **Payment Status Page**: Endpoint to view the status of a payment and its details.
- **Real-time Notifications**: Uses Socket.IO to emit events when payments are confirmed.
